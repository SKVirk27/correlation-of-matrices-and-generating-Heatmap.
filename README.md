Correlation of miRNA Expression
Description: This script performs correlation analysis on two miRNA expression matrices from different cancer types and generates heatmaps to visualize the correlations.

Key Features:

Calculates Pearson correlation for each matrix.
Generates heatmaps for both matrices individually.
Computes correlation between the two matrices.
Outputs include matrix1_corr.csv, matrix2_corr.csv, and Corr_matrix1&2.csv.
Required Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

Execution:

Ensure the required files (matrix1.txt, matrix2.txt, main.py) are in the same folder.
Open the project in PyCharm and set the working folder as Assignment1.
Run main.py to execute the script and generate the heatmaps and correlation matrices.
